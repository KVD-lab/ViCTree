<h3>
ViCTree: An automated framework to aid taxonomic classification of viruses
</h3>

ViCTree is a bioinformatics framework that automatically selects new candidate virus sequences from GenBank, generates multiple sequence alignments, calculates a maximum likelihood phylogeny and, is capable of automatically building new phylogenies when new data is available on GenBank.
